# Ngx

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.1.

From: http://www.mukeshkumar.net/articles/angular5/building-an-angular-5-cli-project-with-ngx-bootstrap

Simple demo showing how to use ngx and some components.
It uses a navbar but no collabsible menu.
There is no Angular Material in this project.

Note that I did not use article's technique of including bootstrap.min.css in styles.css (had error).
I instead used instructions found at 
https://valor-software.com/ngx-bootstrap/#/documentation#getting-started
for including in index.html.

Like how he uses shared-bootstrap.module.ts for separation of concern.

He includes routing despite not using it.

He does not include a git project but demo easy enough to create.
